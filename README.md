## Introduction

Elchin Jafarli and Zaman Kazimov collaborate on implementing sorting algorithms with the goal of providing clear, efficient, and well-documented code. The project is part of the Holberton School curriculum.

## Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort:** [0-bubble_sort.c](0-bubble_sort.c) - Implements the bubble sort algorithm.
2. **Insertion Sort:** [1-insertion_sort_list.c](1-insertion_sort_list.c) - Implements the insertion sort algorithm.
3. **Selection Sort:** [2-selection_sort.c](2-selection_sort.c) - Implements the selection sort algorithm.
4. **Quick Sort:** [3-quick_sort.c](3-quick_sort.c) - Implements the quick sort algorithm.

- [sort.h](sort.h) - Header file with function prototypes and struct definitions.

## Folder Structure

- `0-O`: Contains information about the Big O notation and improvements for the bubble sort algorithm.
- `1-O`: Focuses on the Big O notation of the sorting algorithms.
- `2-O`: Correction and improvements in the Big O implementation.
- `LICENSE`: GPL-3.0 license file.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `print_array.c` and `print_list.c`: Helper functions for printing arrays and linked lists.

## Usage

To use these sorting algorithms, you can include the respective C files in your project and call the appropriate functions. Make sure to follow the included header file for function prototypes.

## Contributing
